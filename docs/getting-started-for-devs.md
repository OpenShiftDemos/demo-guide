The Getting Started with OpenShift for Developers workshop is an introduction 
to developing applications on OpenShift and is ideal to introduce the basics. 
The workshop is supported for OpenShift 4.8 and above and the following 
programming languages: Java, Node.js, Python, and .NET.

The workshop consists of the following topics:

* Using the OpenShift command line client and web console.
* Deploying an application using a pre-existing container image.
* Working with application labels to identify component parts.
* Scaling up your application in order to handle web traffic.
* Exposing your application to users outside of the cluster.
* Viewing and working with logs generated by your application.
* Accessing your application container and interacting with it.
* Giving access to other users to collaborate on your application.
* Deploying an application from source code in a Git repository.
* Deploying a database from the OpenShift service catalog.
* Configuring an application so it can access a database.
* Setting up web hooks to enable automated application builds.

Additional topics may also be covered relevant to the specific programming 
language used by the applications being deployed.
