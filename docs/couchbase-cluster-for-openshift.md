Couchbase Cluster for OpenShift

This workshop showcases Couchbase's Cluster Operator solution deployed on OpenShift. Couchbase Cluster exposes a scale-out, key-value store with managed cache for sub-millisecond data operations, purpose-built indexers for efficient queries and a powerful query engine for executing SQL-like queries.


This workshop automatically provisions the Couchbase Operator on OpenShift 4.6, which can then be used in conjunction with [this simple Tiwtter-based demo](https://github.com/couchbase-partners/redhat-pds). The demo will cover the following topics:

* Creating Couchbase Secrets
* Deploying a two-node Couchbase Cluster
* Exposing the Couchbase Admin UI
* Creating data buckets
* Configuring and deploying an application which ingests content from Twitter, stores it in the cluster, and displays it dynamically using an API service.
