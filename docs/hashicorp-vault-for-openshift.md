The focus of this workshop is to show how individual services can authenticate and request their own set of distinct credentials through the use of Vault, rather than having to share credentials and tokens among different pods and services. OpenShift will be utilized to safely incorporate secrets into both applications and infrastructure.

This workshop demonstrates HashiCorp Vault fully deployed and running in OpenShift and covers the following topics:

* Configuring Prerequisites
* Configuring the Vault Kubernetes authentication
* Deploying: Request secrets directly from Vault
* Deploying: Secrets through Annotations
