The OpenShift full-stack installer is designed to help users, ranging from
novices to experts, create OpenShift clusters in various environments. By
default, the installer acts as an installation wizard, prompting the user for
the minimum set of values that it cannot determine on its own while providing
reasonable defaults for everything else. It prompts the user for the least
amount of information required at day-0 for the target platform. This video
goes through a full-stack installation on Google Cloud. For more information,
refer to the [installer
documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/installing/i
nstalling_gcp/installing-gcp-account.html).
