The CyberArk demo & workshop showcases how to deploy applications in Red Hat OpenShift that can retrieve secrets from the CyberArk Secrets Manager (AKA Conjur).

This workshop demonstrates CyberArk Conjur fully deployed and running in OpenShift and covers the following topics:

1. Application identity and authentication in OpenShift.
2. Database credentials retrieved from CyberArk using REST calls.
3. Database credentials retrieved from CyberArk and injected into an application as environment variables, using the open source tool Summon.
4. Database credentials retrieved from CyberArk and provided as native OpenShift secrets, where an application can mount them as environment variables or volumes.
5. Database credentials not shared with the application, where the application connects to a database using CyberArkâ€™s Secretless Broker.
