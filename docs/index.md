# Welcome

Welcome to the OpenShift Container Platform Demo and Workshop Guide. This
site contains documentation and links to content to help you perform
demonstrations or workshops using OpenShift Container Platform and associated
Red Hat products.

Much of this content is explicitly designed for use with the Red Hat Product
Demo System (RHPDS). However, we strive to provide instructions for how
assets can be deployed into an arbitrary OpenShift environment on your own.

The source code for this site can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/demo-guide).

Please file issues for demos and workshops in their respective documented
repositories. But feel free to file issues for this site and its content at
the repo linked above, and feel free to contribute with pull requests to the
`dev` branch.
