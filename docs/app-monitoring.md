## Self-Paced Learning

Go to [this](https://www.amazon.com/) learning module to explore some of the
key features of utilizing application metrics.

## Demo

There are two ways to demonstrate this functionality. You can log into the
Red Hat Product Demo System (RHPDS) and choose
Catalog->Demos->OpenShift4->Application Monitoring. Another option is using
Code Ready Containers with the code found [here](https://github.com).

## Workshop

This functionality can be experienced and taught as part of the [Advanced Operations Workshop](http://redhat.readthedocs.io).
