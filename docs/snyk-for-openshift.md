Snyk empowers developers to easily find and fix vulnerabilities in applications running on OpenShift. This workshop guides users through using [Snyk Container](https://snyk.io/product/container-vulnerability-management) and Snyk [Infrastructure as Code](https://snyk.io/product/infrastructure-as-code-security/) to identify and remediate security and configuration risks in a sample application deployed into OpenShift.

The Snyk on OpenShift workshop provieds a fully deployed and running [Snyk Controller](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360006548317-Install-the-Snyk-controller-with-OpenShift-4-and-OperatorHub) with a deployment of Snyk's vulnerable [Goof](https://github.com/snyk/goof) application and covers the following topics:

1. Reviewing the security and configuration scan results in the Snyk UI.
2. Finding and applying a more secure base image using Snykâ€™s upgrade guidance.
3. Securing the Goof application's deployment configuration within OpenShift.
