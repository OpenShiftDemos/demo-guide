Enterprises see the benefit in using containerized applications to run their mission-critical workloads, but most IT organizations are not standardized on a single infrastructure stack. These heterogeneous environments often carry both Windows and Linux platforms, siloing applications and making it difficult for a business to modernize and scale their operations. The ideal world for customers is a singular container orchestration fabric that supports the two leading commercial operating systems in customer datacenters. Starting with OpenShift 4.4, you can now run a Windows node and deploy Windows containers, side-by-side, with you Linux containers.
