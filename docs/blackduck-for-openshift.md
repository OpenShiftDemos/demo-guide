The Synopsys Black Duck demo & workshop showcases how to scan containers deployed on Red Hat OpenShift with Synopsys' Software Composition Analysis tool, Black Duck, in production workloads.

This workshop demonstrates Black Duck fully deployed and running on OpenShift and will cover the following topics:

1. Black Duck for OpenShift setup.
2. Project & 'pod running' verification.
3. Demo Application details
4. How Black Duck Scanning works.
5. An overview of Black Duck Scanning results.
6. Scanning a custom container.
